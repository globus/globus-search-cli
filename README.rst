Globus Search CLI Client (Alpha!)
=================================

A command-line tool for interacting with Globus Search.

Provides the `globus-search` command.

This product is in Alpha and under active development. Its interface may change
version-to-version.

At a future date, we hope to incorporate this functionality into the
`globus-cli`. At that time, support for this tool will be dropped.

There are no other requirements.
